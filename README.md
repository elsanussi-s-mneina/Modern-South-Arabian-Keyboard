# لوحة مفاتيح للغة السقطرية واللغة المهرية

# Modern-South-Arabian-Keyboard
For typing Soqotri, Mehri, and other related languages

One of the files is for the Macintosh (OS X) operating system. The other is for the Windows Operating Systems.

# Background
I like making keyboard layouts. There are a few letters that are needed for these languages that are not used in writing Arabic, 
hence the need for a different keyboard layout than the ones provided by Windows or Mac OS.
